# -- possible pkgs to use:
# bitstring, (interesting - can define protocol declaratively) https://bitstring.software/examples/
# data-encoding, (interesting, maybe)
# stdint (interesting, useful)

# - not relevant
# extprot (interesting, cross-language generation, not power over representation) 

# - don't want to use 
# bin_prot + pa_bin_prot, (janestreet, depends on base)
